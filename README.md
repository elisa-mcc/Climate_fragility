# Climate fragility in the city of Bologna - MASTERâ€™S DEGREE IN DATA SCIENCE UNIVERSITY OF TRENTO

This study explores the concept of climate fragility in the municipality of Bologna, focusing on the origins and implications of this phenomenon. 
- Identification of *heat and cold islands* in different areas of the city, using temperature data;
- Definition of *Climate Shelter Index*, which scores all green areas as possible climate shelters;
- Development of *Climate Fragility indicator*, considering heat and cool islands, nature-based solutions, and the Climate Shelter Index;
- Understand the impact of climate fragility on the level of overall fragility.
